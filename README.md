# Budget-Tracker

## Synopsis
With this app I want a user to be able to track their budget so that they can be better aware of their spending habits and have a better overview of where it is their money is going to.

## Implementations
I was able to set up the service worker to still be able to show the app even though it is offline. This app now has the capability to add things to the budget whether it is online or offline. Also what ever is added while offline will be added once the app is connected to the internet.

## Future
In the future I want to add in full functionality while the app is offline so then no matter where the user is they can add in their transactions without having to worry about if they have internet or not. I have added in a service worker that does connect so from there I need to continue to work towards that goal.
